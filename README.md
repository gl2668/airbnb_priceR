# airbnb_priceR

### Purpose

[airbnb priceR](https://geraldlee.shinyapps.io/airbnb_priceR/) is a shiny app that was built on R to explore and analyze Airbnb listings and prices in London, UK.

This was built for my Real Estate Applied Analytics class project - IEOR 4575 at Columbia.

You can use this app to:

* Filter / Look up Airbnb Listings in the UK
* Get the number of listings in the neighbourhood
* Get an estimate Airbnb price based on `neighbourhood` filter, `accommodates` and `bedrooms`
* Get visualisations of `price` and `review_score` for listings in the neighbourhood
